#  TITLE Linked List Implementations in C++

- Repository of implementations ofFour  types of linked lists in C++:

### 1.Singly Linked List
### 2.Doubly Linked List
### 3.Circular Singly Linked List
### 4.Circular Doubly Linked List


# 1-__Singly Linked List_


- A data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence The program contains

- Adding student data at the start or the end, or any specific position.

- Remove the student data at the beginning, end, or specific position.

-Search for sudent by their ID.



Display the list of all of them by selecting from the Main menu



### SINGLY LINKED LIST MENU**


1. Insert at beginning

2. Insert at end

3. Insert at position

4. Delete from beginning

5. Delete from end

6. Delete from position

7. Search for element

8. Display list
9. Exit

10.

# 2-_Doubly Linked List_

- linear data structure in which all nodes have pointers to the next and previous nodes Program includes:

-Similar operations as the singly linked list, with bidirectional traversal.



### DOUBLE LINKED LIST MENU

1. Insert at beginning

2. Insert at end

3. Insert at position

4. Delete from beginning

5. Delete from end

6. Delete from position

7. Search for element

8. Display list

9. Exit

# 3-_Circular Singly Linked List_



### CIRCULAR SINGLY LINKED LIST MENU

1. Insert at beginning

2. Insert at end

3. Insert at position

4. Delete from beginning

5. Delete from end

6. Delete from position

7. Search for element

8. Display list

9. Exit

# 4-_Circular Doubly Linked List_



### CIRCULAR DOUBLY LINKED LIST MENU



1. Insert at beginning

3. Insert at end

4. Insert at position

5. Delete from beginning

6. Delete from end

7. Delete from position

8. Search for element

9. Display list

10. Exit



# _OVERVIEW_

  
Every implementation of linked lists provides typical operations such as insertion, deletion, searching,
and printing the list. The main differences between the implementations are in the structure and behavior of the nodes:
 Singly  Linked List: _Each node points to  the next nodes only.
 

 Doubly Linked List: _Each node points to both the next and previous nodes._

 Circular Singly Linked List: _Same as a singly linked list, except that the last node points to the first node._

 Circular Doubly Linked List: _Similar to a doubly linked list,_

except that the last node points to the first node, and the first node points to the last node.
_FEATURE__


## Deletions

From the beginning
From the end
From any given position

## Searching

-Find a node by using a unique identifier (e.g., ID)
-Display: Print all the nodes in the list
## Compiling and Running in Dev-C++

for compiling and running C++ programs with Dev-C++, a minimal IDE for Windows.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following:

Dev-C++ is installed on your computer. You can download it from Dev-C++ Website.

Your computer meets the system requirements to run Dev-C++.


# How the Code Works

## The steps for working with this code are as follows:

### Enter Inputs:

The program prompts the user to input details (e.g., name, age, ID) for each operation.

### Perform Operations: Based on the user's choice (from the menu),
the program performs on the linked list the selected operation (e.g., insert a node, delete a node).

__examples based on the menu-driven linked list program__

### AFTER RUN THE PROGRAM__

### if you press 1

### INSERT DATA AT BEGGINNING

# Your choice: 1
### Enter name: WAKJIRA

### Enter age: 24

### Enter ID: 20996

# Successfully added at beginning.

 ### INSERT DATA AT END


# Your choice: 2
### Enter name: CHALA

### Enter age: 23

### Enter ID: 20934

# Successfully added at end.


# DELETE THE DATA


# Your choice: 1
### Enter name: ACHALU

### Enter age: 35

### Enter ID: 2123

### Successfully added at beginning.

# Your choice: 8

### Student List:

### Student 1:

### Name: ACHALU

### Age: 35

### ID: 2123

# Your choice: 4
### _Deleted: ACHALU_

 # AND ALSO WITHOUT DATA IF YOU WANT TO DISPLAY__


# Your choice: 8
# List is empty!

 
 # TE SAME AS TRUE FOR ALL

__THE PROGRAM DOES NOT TERMINATE (STOP) IF YOU ENTER SYMBOLS OR DATA TYPE__

### Open Dev-C++: Launch the IDE on your computer.

### Write the Code: Paste the code into a new.cpp file.

### Save the File: Save the file with a.cpp extension, for example, linked_list.cpp.

### Compile the Code: Go to Execute > Compile (or press F9) to compile and check for errors.

### Run the Program: Click Run > Execute (or press F10) to see the output of the program.
